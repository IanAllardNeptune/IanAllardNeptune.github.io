# Introduction

My project is to analyze the DOGE.gov website. The DOGE department of the United States Government is the Department of Government Efficiency. Spearheaded in the second Trump Administration primarily by Elon Musk, the department focuses on cutting down on costs from various government sectors by what it deems unnecessary spending. Siding with the Trump administration's general interests, the defunding and rejection of renewing grants is driven by political agendas. For example, the NY Times discovered that government documents containing [this list](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html) of words are disappearing from records. It is difficult to determine what is "saving" and what is just the Trump administration pushing its ideology.


In addition to the removal of several key contracts, multiple articles and papers have exposed inaccuracies in the false claims the DOGE.gov website provides. The main page of the savings section sums up all of the contracts that they claimed to have saved. The main goal of my project is to detect inaccuracies across the website in what they claimed to have saved. There are a couple of places that I am analyzing to compare the data they present and what the reality is. The first place is [the API](https://api.doge.gov/docs) that they provide.


##### These two graphs are derived from data scraped from the API. Specifically, the grants and leases:
