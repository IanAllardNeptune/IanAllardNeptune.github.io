# Intro

This lab focuses on querying a World Bank API with thousands of data points pertaining to different categories (or indicators of different countries during various years. From this lab, I learned new skills in querying APIs (at least better than before), sifting through API documentation (something I am still improving on), and outputting results into a file.


### Indicators I chose

The indicators I was curious in were: gdp_growth_annual, labor_force, and male_children_out_of_school. The main reason I chose this indicator was simply because I found them fascinating when I was looking through the documentation. The gdp_growth_annual was very helpful to me as it shows the country's general success and trajectory. A constant throughout all of the countries was the decline in 2020 due to Covid-19, which, when I spotted made a lot of sense. Notably, India showed the most GDP growth annually by far, which aligns with my former understanding of the country as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world right now.

I initially chose male_children_out_of_school simply because it sounded like something that might ary largely between countries. It was, however, as multiple values did not show up. China did not have a single value within my year range! I found this to be odd so I looked into the documentation of this indicator.
