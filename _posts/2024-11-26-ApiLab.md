# Intro

This lab focuses on querying a World Bank API with thousands of data points pertaining to different categories (or indicators of different countries during various years. From this lab, I learned new skills in querying APIs (at least better than before), sifting through API documentation (something I am still improving on), and outputting results into a file.


### Indicators I chose

The indicators I was curious in were: gdp_growth_annual, labor_force, and male_children_out_of_school. The main reason I chose this indicator was simply because I found them fascinating when I was looking through the documentation. 

Here are some of the interesting indicators: 

The **gdp_growth_annual** was very helpful to me as it shows the country's general success and trajectory. A constant throughout all of the countries was the decline in 2020 due to Covid-19, which, when I spotted it, made a lot of sense. Notably, India showed the most GDP growth annually by far, which aligns with my former understanding of the country as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world right now.

I initially chose **male_children_out_of_school** simply because it sounded like something that might vary mainly between countries. It was, however, as multiple values did not show up. China did not have a single value within my year range! I found this to be odd so I looked into the documentation of this indicator.

As denoted in the graph's x-axis they stopped reporting this data after 1997. This sent me down a rabbit hole in which I researched possibilities of why this data was not present in China, which led me to the general answer that mass reform of education occured in China starting in [1997 and the early 2000s]([https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958](https://www.edu.cn/english/education/Researchedu/200603/t20060323_21831.shtml)). It is difficult to say why these reforms exactly impact their reporting of data, but it is safe to say that there must have been some legislation that changed the former flow of information to the World Bank.
