# Intro

This lab focuses on querying a World Bank API with thousands of data points pertaining to different categories (or indicators of different countries during various years. From this lab, I learned new skills in querying APIs (at least better than before), sifting through API documentation (something I am still improving on), and outputting results into a file.


### Indicators I chose

The indicators I was curious in were: gdp_growth_annual, labor_force, electricity_access, short_term_debt, and male_children_out_of_school. The main reason I chose this indicator was simply because I found them fascinating when I was looking through the documentation. 

Here are some of the interesting indicators: 

The **gdp_growth_annual** was very helpful to me as it shows the country's general success and trajectory. A constant throughout all of the countries was the decline in 2020 due to Covid-19, which, when I spotted it, made a lot of sense. Notably, India showed the most GDP growth annually by far, which aligns with my former understanding of the country as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world right now.

I initially chose **male_children_out_of_school** simply because it sounded like something that might vary mainly between countries. It was, however, as multiple values did not show up. China did not have a single value within my year range! I found this to be odd so I looked into the documentation of this indicator.

As denoted in the graph's x-axis, they stopped reporting this data after 1997. This sent me down a rabbit hole in which I researched possibilities of why this data was not present in China, which led me to the general answer that mass reform of education occured in China starting in [1997 and the early 2000s](https://www.edu.cn/english/education/Researchedu/200603/t20060323_21831.shtm). It is difficult to say why these reforms exactly impact their reporting of data, but it is safe to say that there must have been some legislation that changed the former flow of information to the World Bank.

The **short-term_debt** was chosen because I wanted to compare the listed country's debt, but this indicator also had issues. This time it was the US who did not have informaiton. On the World Bank documentation for this indicator the US did not hvae one value!

I truly have no idea why this is true.


### Countries That I Looked At

I chose the United States, Russia, India, China, and Uzbekistan. My main reason was to choose countries that I had some familiarity with (plus Uzbekistan) so I could contextualize the outputted data. The code for choosing the countries was very simple, as I made a dictionary and matched each country to its country_iso3 code. This was hard-coded, and I plan to improve it by automating it and adding more countries, but I made it like this because they are two of the three parameters I need to put into my countryYear class. The last parameter was the years, which I dealt with later in the code.

```python

#Snippet of the CountryYear class 
class CountryYear:
    def __init__(self, name, country_iso3, year):

#Dictonary of Countries and their country_iso3 values
countries_iso3 = {
    "United States": "USA",
    "China": "CHN",
    "Russia": "RUS",
    "India": "IND",
    "Uzbekistan": "UZB"
}

```

### Years

I chose the year range 2010 - 2023. Similarly to the countries I chose a range that I would be able to contextulize because I have much more information on this time period. Also data collection is most certainly better in the 2010s and 2020s than the 90s and so on. As I discussed a little in the Indicator portion it is interesting to see the effect Covid-19 had on all the countries' various indicators. The code for this was relatively simple. As I explained above, this was the last parameter my CountryYear class needed. I made a years variable equal to a range() so I could then interate through those years.


```python

    #Choosing the year range
    years = range(2010, 2024)

    #Using all parameters to establish an object in the class of CountryYear
    for country, iso3 in countries_iso3.items():
        for year in years:
            country_year = CountryYear(country, iso3, year)

```
