# Intro

I went into this project seeking out a fairly clean dataset with something I'm interested in. I ended up finding this (relatively) clean  [Dataset]([https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data)) on the NBA. It shows some of the most important NBA stats for each player in pts, reb, ast, etc. from the 1996-1997 season to the 2022-2023 season.


### Analysis

When comparing the different variables I tried to test things that I thought would make sense and then actually test them with the data.

###### Player Weight / Pts

The first comparison I tried was Player Weight as the independent and Pts as the dependent. Going into this specific test, I did not expect a high correlation between the differing sizes of NBA players. There are stars from all different heights, and therefore, we should expect not to see a super-defined slope.

The slope was just as I expected, not prominent.

After running the .describe(): 

```python
nbadata[["player_weight", "pts"]].describe()
```

I received: 

| Statistic   | player_weight  | pts        |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| count       | 12844.000000   | 12844.000000 |
| mean        | 100.263279     | 8.212582   |
| std         | 12.426628      | 6.016573   |
| min         | 60.327736      | 0.000000   |
| 25%         | 90.718400      | 3.600000   |
| 50% (median)| 99.790240      | 6.700000   |
| 75%         | 108.862080     | 11.500000  |
| max         | 163.293120     | 36.100000  |

Notably, the STD for this comparison is not that important as there is minimal correlation between the variables anyway. The pts show a very high variability with 6.0 as the STD, which shows that there are likely many things that impact players' scoring, but weight is simply not a significant one.

###### Player Height / Reb & Player / Ast

Contrary to weight and pts, when testing height with rebounds and assists, I expected high levels of correlation. This is because we should positionally expect shorter players to take the ball down the court and look to pass to teammates to score and taller players to more easily rebound the ball.

I was pleased with the results of these two graphs as they were exactly what I predicted. There is a positive correlation between height and reb, as intuitively, taller players have the role of rebounding the ball. A negative correlation exists between height and assists, as taller players have the ball in their hands less in passing positions.
