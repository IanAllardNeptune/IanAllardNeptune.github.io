# Intro

I went into this project seeking out a fairly clean dataset with something I'm interested in. I ended up finding this (relatively) clean  [Dataset]([https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data)) on the NBA. It shows some of the most important NBA stats for each player in pts, reb, ast, etc. from the 1996-1997 season to the 2022-2023 season.
