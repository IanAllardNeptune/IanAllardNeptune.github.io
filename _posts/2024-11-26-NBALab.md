# Intro

I went into this project seeking out a fairly clean dataset with something I'm interested in. I ended up finding this (relatively) clean  [Dataset]([https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data)) on the NBA. It shows some of the most important NBA stats for each player in pts, reb, ast, etc. from the 1996-1997 season to the 2022-2023 season.


### Analysis

When comparing the different variables I tried to test things that I thought would make sense and then actually test them with the data.

###### Player Weight / Pts

The first comparison I tried was Player Weight as the independent and Pts as the dependent. Going into this specific test, I did not expect a high correlation between the differing sizes of NBA players. There are stars from all different heights, and therefore, we should expect not to see a super-defined slope.

The slope was just as I expected, not prominent.

After running the .describe(): 

```python
nbadata[["player_weight", "pts"]].describe()
```

I received: 

| Statistic   | player_weight  | pts        |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| count       | 12844.000000   | 12844.000000 |
| mean        | 100.263279     | 8.212582   |
| std         | 12.426628      | 6.016573   |
| min         | 60.327736      | 0.000000   |
| 25%         | 90.718400      | 3.600000   |
| 50% (median)| 99.790240      | 6.700000   |
| 75%         | 108.862080     | 11.500000  |
| max         | 163.293120     | 36.100000  |

Notably, the STD for this comparison is not that important as there is minimal correlation between the variables anyway. The pts show a very high variability with 6.0 as the STD, which shows that there are likely many things that impact players' scoring, but weight is simply not a significant one.

###### Player Height / Reb & Player / Ast

Contrary to weight and pts, when testing height with rebounds and assists, I expected high levels of correlation. This is because we should positionally expect shorter players to take the ball down the court and look to pass to teammates to score and taller players to more easily rebound the ball.

![Playerheight to reb](/assets/img/heightreb.png)

![Playerweight to ast](/assets/img/heightast.png)

I was pleased with the results of these two graphs as they were exactly what I predicted. There is a positive correlation between height and reb, as intuitively, taller players have the role of rebounding the ball. A negative correlation exists between height and assists, as taller players have the ball in their hands less in passing positions.


##### Heat Map of Pts, Reb, Ast, Net Rating (+/-)

Another key thing I was interested in was the net_rating, which, according to the dataset's Kaggle documentation, was a similar stat to the widely kept plus-minus (+/-), which tracks what the net score of the game while the particular player is in the game. I did not want to simply make multiple scatter plots for each relationship between the critical variables and net_rating, so I did some research and found documentation on a heat map.

![HeatMap](/assets/img/heatmap.png)

The map worked well to demonstrate the correlations, but the r values seem slightly low, specifically with net_rating. I believe this is due to the niche statistic of net_rating when compared to the leading counting stats of reb, ast, and pts. However, there is enough correlation to see that points impact net_rating the most. This makes the most sense as it is the stat that directly increases a plus minus. A player might get many rebounds but lack in other areas that do not contribute to the net winning of the team. Intuitively, it would make more sense if ast were higher than reb in correlation to net_rating, but since they are not, it is likely because when players are focusing on making their other teammates score, they may lack in different parts of their game.

I looked into the variables with this code :

```python
nbadata[["reb", "pts", "ast", "net_rating"]].describe()
```

| Statistic   | reb        | pts        | ast        | net_rating  |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| count       | 12844.0000 | 12844.0000 | 12844.0000 | 12844.0000  |
| mean        | 3.5585     | 8.2126     | 1.8247     | -2.2263     |
| std         | 2.4779     | 6.0166     | 1.8008     | 12.6651     |
| min         | 0.0000     | 0.0000     | 0.0000     | -250.0000   |
| 25%         | 1.8000     | 3.6000     | 0.6000     | -6.4000     |
| 50% (median)| 3.0000     | 6.7000     | 1.2000     | -1.3000     |
| 75%         | 4.7000     | 11.5000    | 2.4000     | 3.2000      |
| max         | 16.3000    | 36.1000    | 11.7000    | 300.0000    |

Looking more closely at the details() of the net_rating stat, it might not be too reliable. The min and max are completely absurd although technically possible. However, the STD is massive and shows very high variability, with this stat showing that it can really go all over the place for a player each season. It is also crucial to note that with any stat like (+/-), players on the best of teams will always have higher (+/-) simply because their teams win more games and score more points. I would expect a stat that depends on many factors like (+/-) to be highly variable, but the STD of ~12.6 is a little out of reason.

Overall, the heat map was the most interesting part of the several analyses.


## Conclusions On The Dataset

In general, this was a pretty strong dataset that completed what it set out to demonstrate the most essential NBA statistics. The one issue I ran into with this set was five values that did not make sense and had to be weeded out. One player was repeated three times with different stats in the same year. Two other players were drafted in the 0th round, which also didn't make sense. I cleaned up the dataset to make the values work for a Draft Round to Pts comparison, but I did not find a great way to demonstrate the data, and it was not very interesting either way, so it was not included. Besides those difficulties, I thought the dataset was solid, which led me to make some interesting conclusions about trends in the NBA.
