## First Graph: Fertility In Different Countries

When looking through various NYT Articles, I came across an article [an article](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-nov-15-2023.html) about fertility in different countries, which looked somewhat similar to the [Bubble Chart Demo](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/natural_disasters.html) on Vega-Altair. However, there are some blatant differences between the demo and the NYT Graph, indicating that there was a lot to change to achieve a similar graph.

Some of the most significant changes I made to the graph came first and were relatively easy. The horizontal orientation needed to be changed with the demo graph. Interestingly, I noted that the NYT graph had no x-axis. The first thing I tried with the bubble chart was removing the axis entirely, which, to my surprise, worked quite well and ended up in my final version of the graph.

```python
  alt.X()
        .title(None),
```

After fixing this problem, it was difficult to decide where to go next as there were many problems to fix. The most obvious one was the simple difference in information the demo illustrated compared to the fertility rate. The NYT article had the quantitative fertility rate as a channel on the y-axis, with the country population as a mark for the bubble sizes. The demo dataset had the categorical type of "disaster," the number of deaths, and the year the disaster occurred. Because of the conflicting variable types, there was no way in which I could use the original dataset to make a similar one to fertility rates. I tried to find a similar Vega dataset with matching variable types, but it was a tedious process, and I knew that even if I found matching variable types, the distribution would look very off compared the original. Eventually, I concluded that I should draw up the data. Fortunately, we had an exact project on querying World Bank Data, which has access to all the information I needed! After tweaking [the project](https://ianallardneptune.github.io/2024-11-26-ApiLab/) to exclusively create a CSV with the only information of country name, fertility rate, and population, I was done!

| Country      | ISO3 | Year | Fertility Rate | Population |
|-------------|------|------|----------------|------------|
| Aruba       | ABW  | 2022 | 1.179          | 107,359    |
| Afghanistan | AFG  | 2022 | 4.523          | 41,454,761 |
| Angola      | AGO  | 2022 | 5.209          | 36,749,906 |
| Albania     | ALB  | 2022 | 1.376          | 2,745,972  |
| ...         | ...  | ...  | ...            | ...        |

Now, I set the y-axis as the fertility rate and the country population as the bubble size, and immediately, the chart looked much better! There were, however, still glaring issues with the graph. The main one was that all of the data was in one straight line on the y-axis.
It took me a little while to figure this out, but after [some research](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/strip_plot_jitter.html#gallery-strip-plot-jitter), I discovered jitter, which offsets y values: precisely like the NYT Graph. Lastly, the "Replacement Rate" Line was very easy to add as there was [tons of documentation](https://github.com/vega/altair/issues/2059) for something this common.

Here are the fixes:

```python
#Jitter
source["Jitter"] = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=2, size=len(source))  
        ...
  alt.X('Jitter:Q')  
        .axis(None),  

#Line
line = alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame({'y': [2.1]})).mark_rule(
    strokeDash=[2, 2],  
    color='red'
).encode(
    y='y:Q'
)
```



This is the final result:

## Second Graph: Train Derailments: FAILURE!

I looked at another NYT article for my second graph on [train derailments](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/02/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-march-8-2023.html). It is pretty comparable to the Altair demo of [One Dot Per ZipCode](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/one_dot_per_zipcode.html).

For me, going into this second graph, the question was how to replicate the train derailment with only the information of all the US ZipCodes. I eventually came up with the idea to group multiple zip codes in one area to form one larger vertex on the map (essentially representing population density). When jumping into documentation, this idea was much more difficult than I thought. There isn't that much on my specific problem, and the stuff that does relate seems not to be as closely associated with Altair. Unfortunately, I do not have a final result, but I will continue to look into this problem. Another solution would be to look into train derailment data, but since I spent so much time on the first graph engineering the data, I figured I'd try something else for this one.
