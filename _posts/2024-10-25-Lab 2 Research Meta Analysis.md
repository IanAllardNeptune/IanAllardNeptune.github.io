#Intro

I am interested in artificial intelligence, so I chose a paper on the topic. I eventually found this paper about the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in detecting mental health crises. Specifically, the researchers made an AI model that tracks peopleâ€™s social media posts and determines whether or not they are likely to have a depressive episode.
