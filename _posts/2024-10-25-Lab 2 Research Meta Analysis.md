# Intro

I am interested in artificial intelligence, so I chose a paper on the topic. I eventually found [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958)   about the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in detecting mental health crises. Specifically, the researchers made an AI model that tracks people’s social media posts and determines whether or not they are likely to have a depressive episode. 

### The Authors

There are only two authors cited for the paper who voice some concerns. The first, Masab A. Mansoor, a "Medical Student at Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine," has written multiple papers on various subjects relating to his practice in medicine. I noted how he is credited to 12 papers, 11 of which were made in 2024. 


The next author, Kashif H. Ansari, has been an oncologist for over 20 years and received his medical degree from DOW University of Health Sciences. He has only made one paper. Immediately, several red flags are present from just the information about the authors. They cite no one else for this paper, which seems unrealistic as it is a comprehensive study of artificial intelligence, which an oncologist and a medical student need to be more qualified for. 

### Content

#### Beginning:

This paper's general issue is that the exact goal it is trying to achieve is unclear. The basic premise is testing current AI's capabilities to detect mental health crises, but the way the data is analyzed and the conclusions are all over the place. If I had to diagnose a **Null Hypothesis:** There is no correlation between people’s social media presence and their potential to have a mental health crisis. Making the **Alternate Hypothesis:** There is a correlation between people’s social media presence and their potential to have a mental health crisis. However, as I stated, the conclusions the paper eventually makes are not directly correlated to these hypotheses.

The paper clearly describes the need for better research in this field, as the potential of having a functioning AI to aid with mental health could save thousands of lives. This field is in its "infancy" and needs much more improvement before it becomes practical for real-life use. Another aspect of the mental health / AI field they touch on is the ethics behind gathering people's social media posts. They introduce the point very briefly that taking public posts may be unethical but never address it again until the end of the paper when they explain that "Patient consent was waived due to all data being publicly available." This is quite hand-wavy as it acknowledges the potential issues but hypocritically uses public information in the study. I would have appreciated a more fleshed-out segment dedicated to privacy, which I think will likely be the future make or break of AI in this field. 


#### The Method of the Study

The AI network created was a multimodal deep learning model that "[integrates] natural language processing and temporal analysis techniques." The model was trained on a data set of 996,452 social media posts across different social media in different languages. The method by which this paper intends to evaluate the AI's performance is by comparing its results with professional psychiatric assessments. There were three phases, including "data collection, model development, and validation".

####### Data Collection, Model Development, and Validation.


They went through a stringent process of only collecting public data which then went through phases of depersonalization to make sure the practice was ethical. The initial collecting of the data from various social media sites was made easy as most of them have built-in APIs to sift through posts on their platform.

The model architecture was relatively straightforward and largely used preexisting networks for different stages, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a well-known NLP model developed by Google specialized for AI analysis of text, and established AI architectures such as the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), which specializes in sequence data. The general theme behind their model was that it largely meshed together from different pre-trained models. They used common splitting of data into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%). But, an interesting note from this section was 




An interesting note from this section was the hardware that they trained their model on. I was curious asked ChatGPT to calculate an estimated price of how much their exact usage of hardware would have cost, and ChatGPT gave a range of $84,400 and $255,300!!! Looking into Chat

Notably, the researchers state at the end of the paper that the research received no external funding!
