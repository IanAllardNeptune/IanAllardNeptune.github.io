# Intro

I am interested in artificial intelligence, so I chose a paper on the topic. I eventually found [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/958)   about the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in detecting mental health crises. Specifically, the researchers made an AI model that tracks peopleâ€™s social media posts and determines whether or not they are likely to have a depressive episode. 

### The Authors

There are only two authors cited for the paper who voice some concerns. The first, Masab A. Mansoor, a "Medical Student at Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine," has written multiple papers on various subjects relating to his practice in medicine. I noted how he is credited to 12 papers, 11 of which were made in 2024. 


The next author, Kashif H. Ansari, has been an oncologist for over 20 years and received his medical degree from DOW University of Health Sciences. He has only made one paper. Immediately, several red flags are present from just the information about the authors. They cite no one else for this paper, which seems unrealistic as it is a comprehensive study of artificial intelligence, which an oncologist and a medical student need to be more qualified for.
